<b>How does international law, which lacks a centralized judiciary or enforcer, keep pace with rapid technological change?</b> I am a PhD Candidate at Columbia University whose research leverages game theory, computerized text analysis, archival research, and survey-experimental methods to provide empirical traction on this theme, particularly in an international security and cyber law context. My research on the political economy of technology law has been supported by the Fulbright Program, the US Department of State (Title VIII), the Department of Education (FLAS), and other generous sources.
