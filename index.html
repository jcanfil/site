<b>How is rapid technological change impacting the practice of international law?</b> I am a political scientist (PhD Columbia) whose research leverages game theory, computerized text analysis, archival research, and experimental methods to provide empirical traction on this question. I focus primarily on the law of cyber conflict and emerging challenges for arms control.
<br><br> 
I am currently a research fellow with Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute and hold concurrent postdoctoral research/teaching positions with the Harvard-Columbia China and the World Program, the Harvard Belfer Center, and the Cybersecurity Program at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. I continue to serve as an adjunct professor for the Kent Global Security Program.
<br><br> 
My research on the international political economy of technology law has been supported by the Fulbright Program, the National Science Foundation (DDRIG), the US Department of State (Title VIII), the US Fulbright Commission, and the Department of Education (FLAS). I am based in NYC and Cambridge MA.
