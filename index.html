I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. My research leverages game theory, computational text analysis, archival research, and experimental methods to provide empirical traction on questions about how the US, China, and other states use law and technology to navigate their security interests.

Starting in the fall of 2023, I will be an Assistant Professor of International Relations & Emerging Technologies at Carnegie Mellon University, a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and a research scholar with Princeton's Center on Contemporary China. Previously, I was a fellow with the Columbia-Harvard China and the World Program and received a Fulbright Scholarship to conduct doctoral research in China. I received my PhD from Columbia University.
