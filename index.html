Justin Key Canfil is an Assistant Professor of International Relations & Emerging Technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. His research explores the impact of emerging technologies on international law and arms control. He has particular interest in explaining how the US, China, and other states use law and technology to navigate their security interests. He writes in the third person only to avoid confusing Google Knowledge Panel. From 2024-2025, Canfil will be on leave from CMU, first as a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and then as a research scholar with Princeton's Center on Contemporary China. Previously, he held fellowships with the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Columbia-Harvard China and the World Program, and the China Fulbright Program. He received his PhD from Columbia University.
