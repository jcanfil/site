I am a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Starting in the fall of 2023, I will be an Assistant Professor of International Relations & Emerging Technologies at Carnegie Mellon University and a research associate with Princeton's Center on Contemporary China. I hold a PhD in Political Science from Columbia University.
<br><br> 
My research leverages game theory, computerized text analysis, archival research, and experimental methods to provide empirical traction on questions about how the US, China, and other states use law and technology to navigate their foreign policy interests, especially in cyberspace. 
<br><br> 
Previously, I was a fellow with the Columbia-Harvard China and the World Program and received a Fulbright Scholarship to conduct doctoral research in China. My work on the law and politics of science and technology has been supported by the the National Science Foundation, the US Department of State (Title VIII), the Department of Education (FLAS), and other major sources.
