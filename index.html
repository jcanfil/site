<b>How does international law, which lacks a centralized judiciary or enforcer, keep pace with rapid technological change?</b> I am a PhD Candidate at Columbia University whose research leverages game theory, computerized text analysis, archival research, and survey-experimental methods to provide empirical traction on this theme, particularly in an international security context. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Fulbright Program, and the US Department of State (Title VIII) and Department of Education (FLAS).
