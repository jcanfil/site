<b>How does international law, which lacks a centralized judiciary or enforcer, keep pace with rapid technological change?</b> I am a PhD Candidate at Columbia University whose research leverages game theory, computerized text analysis, archival research, and survey-experimental methods to provide empirical traction on this question. I focus primarily on the law of cyber conflict and emerging challenges for arms control.

In AY 2020-2021, I am a doctoral fellow at Harvard University's Belfer Center, a US-Asia Grand Strategy Fellow at the University of Southern California, and a China Fulbright Scholar (on hiatus pending SARS-CoV-2). My research on the international political economy of technology law has been supported by the Fulbright Program, the National Science Foundation (DDRIG), the US Department of State (Title VIII), and the Department of Education (FLAS).
