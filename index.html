I am an incoming Assistant Professor of International Relations & Emerging Technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. My research explores the impact of emerging technologies on international law and arms control. I am particularly interested in how the US, China, and other states use law and technology to navigate their security interests. From 2024-2025, I will be on leave from CMU, first as a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and then as a research scholar with Princeton's Center on Contemporary China. Previously, I held fellowships with the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Columbia-Harvard China and the World Program, and the China Fulbright Program. I received my PhD from Columbia University.
