I am a political scientist (PhD Columbia) whose interests span international security, emerging technologies, and law. My research leverages game theory, computerized text analysis, archival research, and survey-experimental methods to provide empirical traction on questions about how the US, China, and other states use law and technology to navigate their foreign policy interests, especially in cyberspace. 
<br><br> 
I hold a postdoctoral fellowship with the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School. My research on the law and politics of science and technology has been supported by the Fulbright Program, the National Science Foundation, the US Department of State (Title VIII), the Department of Education (FLAS), and other major sources.
