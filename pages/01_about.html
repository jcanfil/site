I am presently a Fulbright China Scholar (postponed due to SARS-CoV-2 and resuming 2021) at Fudan University's School of International Relations and Public Affairs (复旦大学国际关系与公共事务学院) and Waseda University's School of Political Science and Economics (早稲田大学 政治経済学部). Previously, I held visiting affiliations at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, the London School of Economics (LSE) Department of Law, Peking University, and the University of Oxford. Columbia remains my primary affiliation.
