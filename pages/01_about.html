I am presently a Fulbright Scholar affiliated with Fudan University's School of International Relations and Public Affairs (复旦大学国际关系与公共事务学院) and Waseda University's School of Political Science and Economics (早稲田大学 政治経済学部). I was previously a Resident Research Scholar at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute. In the past, I also held visiting affiliations with the Department of Law at the London School of Economics (LSE), Peking University, and the University of Oxford. Columbia remains my primary affiliation.
