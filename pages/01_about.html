I am an incoming US-Asia Grand Strategy Fellow at the University of Southern California. I am also presently a US Fulbright Scholar affiliated with Fudan University's School of International Relations and Public Affairs (复旦大学国际关系与公共事务学院) and Waseda University's School of Political Science and Economics (早稲田大学 政治経済学部) (postponed due to SARS-CoV-2 and resuming in 2021). Previously, I held visiting positions at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, the Department of Law at the London School of Economics (LSE), Peking University, and the University of Oxford. Columbia remains my primary affiliation.
