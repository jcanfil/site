<h3>Former students!</h3> Always feel free to get in touch. I'd love to hear how you're doing! <br><br>

<h4>Recommendations </h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Recommendations are needed for virtually all jobs after college, and the best ones come from teachers who know you and the quality of your work well. 

<b>I strongly suggest that students first seek out tenured professors to write their letters</b>, since these carry the most weight. Quite understandably, however, not everyone has had the opportunity to develop close working relationships with tenured faculty before graduating.

If you took a class with me and need to ask for a recommendation letter, please email me with the following:<br>
<small>â€‹
<ul>
	<li>Deadline that the letter is due</li>
	<li>How and to whom I should submit it</li>
	<li>Your objectives for the application (e.g. Why are you applying? What are you goals?)</li>
	<li>Unofficial transcripts, a copy of your application statement (if available), and anything else you think I should know about your circumstances or aspirations</li>
</ul>
</small>
I will make the best case for you I can, or let you know if I cannot write it for some reason.
